# Background

**Free Version**

Hi, I'm Jules -- Music Maker, Thinker, Programmer. I'm at my peak when making things in small teams and on my own, and after two years working in China, I'm enjoying working as a Junior Software Developer.

**Full Version**

I'm Jules, a Music graduate with two years experience teaching in Nanjing, China,  and now a Junior Software Developer.

Learning is my drive, so the ever-changing IT industry suits me right down to the ground, along with the teamwork, planning, and problem-solving that comes with it.

I know from broad experience teaching, working with musicians, and recently pair and group programming that I work best as part of a small team, with some focused solo effort.

# Projects
| Title | Description | Development Timeframe | Technologies Used | Test Suites/CIs/CDs Employed |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [Deep Red & Yellow (Connect4 + AI)](https://github.com/Jimjule/deep_red_yellow_connect4) | Inspired by Deep Blue. Wanting to not just learn a new tech, but also a new language, we built a Connect 4 game in Python and trained it to beat itself with Reinforcement Learning. I placed huge importance on optimising the game logic and data structures, since training the AI involves playing hundreds of games. | 2 weeks | Python, Tensorflow, Keras, OpenAI Gym | Pytest |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/Jimjule/Acebook-Team_404) | A diverse team of five work on our interpretation of Facebook with new technologies. This was a learning project, with a focus on Rails and CI/CD. | 2 weeks | Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS (Materialize), PostgreSQL, Heroku | RSpec, Capybara, Travis, Selenium Webdriver |
| [Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/Jimjule/bowling-challenge) | A logic-heavy Javascript challenge, my first time using the constructor/prototype pattern to emulate OOP.  | 1 weekend |HTML/CSS, JavaScript, AJAX | Jasmine  |

# Skills

#### Collaborator

When it comes to working with others, I'm always malleable to the goals of the team, while extracting personal value as it comes.

- During my time at Makers, I pair-programmed every day for weeks, and the scope of partners I worked with has prepared me for future team work.
- As well as pairing, I've worked in self-directed, Agile groups to deliver a product in a limited time, like with Deep Red & Yellow, where we had two weeks to test-drive a logic-heavy game in a new language, and then learn how to implement Reinforcement learning.
- My group strength comes from being able to fill whatever role is necessary, as I have led varied groups of musicians and students, but will take a supporting role for the good of the team.
- Although I had an interest in Natural Language Processing for our final project, I saw the value in learning Python and working with machine learning, so deferred to our other idea, Deep Red & Yellow (https://github.com/Jimjule/deep_red_yellow_connect4).

#### Communicator

I took advantage of the many opportunities presented at university to develop my skills for my previous job as an ESL English teacher. Being a committee member and conductor of the Brunel Film Orchestra & Choir Society provided vital practise in managing large groups, and working with small, goal-oriented groups.

Having played in orchestras from a young age, I've also developed a strong sense of the other half of communication, which is being receptive to what others try to communicate. This capacity proved vital when teaching English to students from a huge range of ages and abilities, as there's a much greater degree of projecting ideas when unsure of the exact terminology.

Accessibility is the name of the game, and before I brought foreign cultures and abstract concepts to students in a second language, I worked with native English speakers, breaking down my understanding of mathematics (and the rest) to help students with learning difficulties.

# Education

#### Makers Academy (January 2019 - April 2019)

- Curious and passionate about code, so I've learned to make the same programs in 4 languages.
- I'm a fast, independant learner, who would rather up the challenge by programming the game that I'm training the AI to play, than import an existing one.
- Initially guarded about the idea of pair-programming, I'm a complete convert to the benefits it brings to my code, and take every opportunity to get feedback when working alone.
- It's encouraging to see that skills from my musical background helped me to excel in group projects here, which feel like a forte of mine.

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Python
- RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Pytest

#### Brunel University London (September 2012 - July 2015)

- Achieved a 2:1 with Honours in Music Composition (BMus)
- Treasurer, Arranger, and Conductor of Brunel's Film Orchestra & Choir Society
- Conducted, played, and sang at several concerts with large and small groups.

# Interests

I live for that feeling of something that I didn't understand 'clicking', so most of my interests are learning based. It's particularly rewarding to have something to show for my effort, so I find ways to turn learning into making.

- Even more software! Currently investigating Java and microprocessors
- Language learning, currently working on Chinese at intermediate level
- A slow-burning interest in competitive games like chess and poker
