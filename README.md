# Background

**Free Version**

Hi, I'm Jules -- Music Maker, Thinker, Programmer. I'm at my peak when making things in small teams and on my own, so now that I'm back from China, the hunt begins for my first Junior Software Developer position.

**Full Version**

I'm Jules, a Music graduate recently home after two years teaching in Nanjing, China to start a new career in Programming.

I'm also a typical INTJ; my core drive is making ideas into finished products, whether that thought came from a musical motif, or a brief for a program. And yes, I like chess.

I'm working towards a position that will require me to learn from constant challenges, and allow me to simply make things.

I know from broad experience teaching, working with musicians, and recently pair and group programming that I work best as part of a small team, with some focused solo effort.

# Projects
| Title | Description | Development Timeframe | Technologies Used | Test Suites/CIs/CDs Employed |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [Deep Red & Yellow (Connect4 + AI)](https://github.com/Jimjule/deep_red_yellow_connect4) | Inspired by Deep Blue, and wanting to not just learn a new tech, but also a new language, we built a Connect 4 game in Python and trained it to beat itself with Reinforcement Learning. I placed huge importance on optimising the game logic and data structures, since training the AI involves playing hundreds of games. | 2 weeks | Python, Tensorflow, Keras, OpenAI Gym | Pytest |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/Jimjule/Acebook-Team_404) | A diverse team of five work on our interpretation of Facebook with new technologies. This was a learning project, with a focus on Rails and CI/CD. | 2 weeks | Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS (Materialize), PostgreSQL, Heroku | RSpec, Capybara, Travis, Selenium Webdriver |
| [Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/Jimjule/bowling-challenge) | A logic-heavy Javascript challenge, my first time using the constructor/prototype pattern to emulate OOP.  | 1 weekend |HTML/CSS, JavaScript, AJAX | Jasmine  |

# Skills

#### Communication

I took advantage of the many opportunities presented at university to develop my skills for my previous job as an ESL English teacher. Being a committee member and conductor of the Brunel Film Orchestra & Choir Society provided vital practise in managing large groups, and working with small, goal-oriented groups.

Having played in orchestras from a young age, I've also developed a strong sense of the other half of communication, which is being receptive to what others try to communicate. This capacity proved vital when teaching English to students from a huge range of ages and abilities, as there's a much greater degree of projecting ideas when unsure of the exact terminology.

Accessibility is the name of the game, and before I brought foreign cultures and abstract concepts to students in a second language, I worked with native English speakers, breaking down my understanding of mathematics (and the rest) to help students with learning difficulties.

# Education

#### Makers Academy (January 2019 - April 2019)

- Curious and passionate about code, so I've learned to make the same programs in 4 languages
- I'm a fast, independant learner, who would rather up the challenge by programming the game that I'm training the AI to play, than import an existing one.
- Great collaborator:
- Clare said: “Jules is a relaxed and supportive pairing partner. He makes sure he involves me even when it's a topic he knows more about and he communicates what he's doing really clearly so we can have a constructive dialogue to move things forward.”
- Kate said: “Working with Jules is a delight. He is calm and capable and works well with all of the team. He is good at taking responsibility and determined in seeing it through.
