# Background

**Free Version**

Hi, I'm Jules -- Music Maker, Thinker, Programmer. I'm at my peak when making things in small teams and on my own, so now that I'm back from China, the hunt begins for my first Junior Software Developer position.

**Full Version**

I'm Jules, a Music graduate recently home after two years teaching in Nanjing, China to start a new career in Programming.

I'm also a typical INTJ; my core drive is making ideas into finished products, whether that thought came from a musical motif, or a brief for a program. And yes, I like chess.

I'm working towards a position that will require me to learn from constant challenges, and allow me to simply make things.

I know from broad experience teaching and working with musicians that I work best as part of a small team, with some focused solo effort.

# Projects
| Title | Description | Development Timeframe | Technologies Used | Test Suites/CIs/CDs Employed |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [CodeCraft](https://github.com/KTSE-2018/KTSE) | Completely indoctrinated by the course, my final project group created a bootcamp survival simulation game. Wanting to learn how to build it from the ground up, we didn't use any game frameworks and used TDD to build our own game logic. | 2 weeks | JavaScript, JQuery, HTML/CSS, Heroku | Mocha, Chai, Sinon |
| [PinkFish (Facebook)](https://github.com/Hemesh-Unka/acebook-pinkFish) | Five rag tag individuals band together and set off to create our interpretation of Facebook with an emphasis on focusing on learning as a group. The site's design was driven by a plush toy of a pink fish found close to our desk. | 2 weeks | Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, JQuery, PostgreSQL,  Heroku, AWS S3 Bucket | RSpec, Capybara, Travis, CodeClimate, Selenium-Webdriver (using headless Chrome) |
| [Tasteless Notes](https://github.com/vivianallen/tastelessnotes) | A group of four christened 'The Tasteless Sheep' create a notes SPA - the caveat being we weren't allowed to use any frameworks. If we wanted to employ TDD, we had to build the test framework ourselves.  | 1 week |HTML/CSS, JavaScript | Tasteless Testing Suite  |

# Skills

#### Communication

I took advantage of the many opportunities presented at university to develop my skills for my previous job as an ESL English teacher. Being a committee member and conductor of the Brunel Film Orchestra & Choir Society provided vital practise in managing large groups, and working with small, goal-oriented groups.

Having played in orchestras from a young age, I've also developed a strong sense of the other half of communication, which is being receptive to what others try to communicate. This capacity proved vital when teaching English to students from a huge range of ages and abilities, 

Accessibility is the name of the game, and before I brought foreign cultures and abstract concepts to students in a second language,
